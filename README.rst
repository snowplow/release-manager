Overview
--------

The release-manager is a Python utility for easily uploading zipped
binaries to a destination target. It allows you to:

-  Create new package versions
-  Upload artifacts to said version
-  Currently only support zip
-  Upload to multiple targets
-  Currently only supports Bintray
-  Combine N binaries into the artifact that is then uploaded
-  Upload N artifacts to for the package

Installing
----------

-  Option 1: Download this repository and run:
   ``python setup.py install``
-  Option 2: Install from pip: ``pip install release-manager``

Usage
-----

::

    usage: release-manager.py [-h] [--config CONFIG] [--make-version]
                              [--make-artifact] [--upload-artifact]
                              [--check-version] [--version]

    Bintray utility for creating and uploading zip packages.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help         show this help message and exit
      --config CONFIG    the path to the configuration yaml file
      --make-version     makes a new version for the package
      --make-artifact    makes the artifacts that will be uploaded
      --upload-artifact  uploads the artifacts to the targets
      --check-version    checks that the version specified matches the build
      --version          show program's version number and exit

Please note when specifying the options to run that they will be applied
to every package in your config file.

Options:

-  You cannot upload the artifacts without also making the artifacts:
-  ``--upload-artifact`` requires ``--make-artifact``
-  Checking the version is useful for automated build tools such as
   travis to assert that you have the correct build versions specified

Config
~~~~~~

The release-manager requires a config be passed to it in the form of a
yaml file. You can find a sample config in the **resources** directory.

Environment resolver
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To get values from the environment at runtime set the value like the
following:

::

    some_env_key: <%= ENV['SOME_ENV_VALUE'] %>

Shell resolver
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To evaluate a shell command at runtime set the value like the following:

::

    some_cmd_value: <%= CMD['cat VERSION'] %>

**NOTE**: If the command does not exit with code 0 the config will not
load.

Variable resolver
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you need to access a variable many-times in your config and it is okay 
for it to be hardcoded you can use the local variable resolver.

This works like so:

::

    some_var_value: "hello_world"
    some_ref_var_value: {{ some_var_value }}

Example config
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::
    
    # Required: local settings
    local:
      root_dir : <%= ENV['TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR'] %>

    # Required: deployment targets
    targets:
      - type     : "bintray" # Options: bintray
        user     : <%= ENV['BINTRAY_USER'] %>
        password : <%= ENV['BINTRAY_PASSWORD'] %>

    # Required: packages to be deployed
    packages:
      - repo     : "generic"
        name     : "release-manager"
        user_org : "jbeemster"
        publish  : true

        # Will attempt to overwrite a published entity if one is found
        override : false

        # If the artifact already exists will determine whether or not
        # to fail the release
        continue_on_conflict : false

        # The version of this package
        version  : <%= CMD['cat VERSION'] %>
        
        # Required IF '--check-version' is passed: will assert that 
        # both versions are the same
        build_version : <%= ENV['TRAVIS_TAG'] %>
        
        # Optional: Build commands
        # You can nest your artifact creation commands here!
        build_commands:
          - ls -ls

        # Required: Artifact
        artifacts:
            # The artifact name is composed like so:
            # {{prefix}}{{version}}{{suffix}}.zip
          - prefix : "release_manager_"
            suffix : ""
            type   : "zip"

            # The binaries to put in the zip
            binary_paths:
              - setup.py
